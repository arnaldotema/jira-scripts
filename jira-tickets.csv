However we see multiple issues here: • The NPS submission rate has been decreasing since ND was released. Less than a third of NPS submissions are coming from the new dashboard.  • Events where the NPS banner was displayed to users are not being tracked in Mixpanel (despite the NPS banner being displayed in ND—we have proof that some submissions are coming from the new dashboard. I suspect this is an issue with our implementation).  • We are unable to export logs from Appcues for NPS displays, only for submissions.   • What we don’t know: • How often the NPS banner is displayed in the new dashboard; therefore, we can’t calculate the submission rate per dashboard.  • What is causing the decrease in the number of submissions. There could be multiple reasons, but it is currently difficult to investigate since we don’t have logs showing when the NPS banner is displayed.    Slack discussion for reference:   Expected behavior? Can we look into why the events are not being tracked? Both the Appcues SDK and the Mixpanel initialization script need to be correctly installed.  Investigate Mixpanel init script and Appcues init script.

"Bug","DSH-5474","2025-03-31T12:27:50.929+0200","[ND] Sound File Upload Issues in CFD","Jergus Kacmar","Nicoletta Donadio","Very high","Open","Unresolved","2025-04-11T11:50:45.713+0200","What happened? Customers uploading sound files via CFD steps, Group Settings, Company/Number Business Hours, and Account > Settings > Sounds are experiencing file upload failures and UX issues. In CFD specifically, users are able to save step forms with a selected sound file, but the file doesn’t play when the caller reaches that step. In many cases, no failure warning is shown during editing, or the warning is not visible or clear enough for users to notice and resolve the issue. How to reproduce? Step by step. In several reported cases, L1 has verified that the uploaded file name appears correctly in the UI, but when calling the associated phone number, the sound file does not play. This suggests the issue may be occurring silently in the background, without proper feedback or error handling for the user. Expected behavior? Users are able to upload sound files in CFD steps, Group Settings, Company/Number Business Hours, and Account > Settings > Sounds. If an upload fails, the user is notified with the reason for the failure and is prevented from saving the form until the issue is resolved. Additional data: • 154557 - 26/02/2025 • After a few days of testing the extensions, we (Admin) have unfortunately encountered an issue with our Call Flow. I (Admin) believe this is the same bug that we have experienced before. We have a recording that is not working, the one named ""Press Extension Or 20s to Main Menu"", although it was working when we did the tests last week. When we make a call and press 1 to dial the extension, we are unable to hear the recording. But if we dial the extension, the call is redirected to the TA that we wish to talk to.  • Reported for - +1 857-214-2664, +1 857-557-6251, +1 857-239-0784, +1 647-694-5673, +1 647-946-8245, +1 647-946-8249  • File name: Press Extension Or 20s to Main Menu  • L1 confirmed file was uploaded via new Dashboard   • 289325 - 27/02/2025 • We (Admin user) have a problem with our process.

"Ticket","DSH-5456","2025-03-27T19:56:13.310+0100","AI Data Delay and Automation Failures","Unassigned","Zoltan Viragh","High","Triaged","Unresolved","2025-04-11T11:15:37.492+0200","Problem Description:The current automation setup relies on sequential API requests for AI-generated call data (Transcript → Sentiment → TLR), each with retry logic. Despite the implementation of retries (up to 17 mins for Transcript, 15 mins for Sentiment, and 15 mins for TLR), calls are still failing due to delays in data availability — sometimes exceeding 30 minutes. Root Concern: • Automation fails when not all AI data is available in time, particularly when Transcript is ready but Sentiment or TLR is not  • This results in incomplete AI data shown in Analytics, impacting usability and customer trust  Reported Impact: • Increased error occurrences in the last 45 minutes: • Call IDs: 837425209, 837413101, 837399467, 837363559   • Customer Company ID: 272539  • MRR at Risk: €2,527.00  Request:Please investigate the delay and inconsistency in API responses (especially for Sentiment and TLR) and help ensure full AI data availability within expected timeframes to avoid automation failures. From Support:  Hi! I was told to escalate this cause it has already been discussed with Arnaldo Tema Issue: 'Previous Message already shared with Arnaldo: Part 1 - Call Ends - Wait 2 mins - API Request for Transcript - If error try again in 5 mins, if error try again in 5 mins, if error try again in 5 mins = 17 minsPart 2 - If API request for Transcript successful then API Request for Sentiment - If error, try again in 5 mins, if error try again in 5 mins, if error try again in 5 mins = 15 minsPart 3 - If API request for Sentiment successful then API Request for TLR - If error, try again in 5 mins, if error try again in 5 mins, if error try again in 5 mins = 15 mins Although I don't have specific examples right now, I have seen calls in Analytics where the AI data is not available and 30 mins or more has passed. What I'm getting at is my current setup should currently catch what the engineer has said is the maximum (although we were previously told 6 mins at absolute max), but the maximum we're experiencing is at least 17 mins or more, hence the automation completing unsuccessfully. It's worth mentioning that sometimes the transcript API request will successfully complete, but then the API request for sentiment or TLR will not, which means that not all of the AI data is available at the same time. In these cases as well, the automation will not compete as we don't have all the data we need for the call.'

Since that’s not the case, I assume she meant that the data simply differs between the two versions. I tried to investigate further but haven’t received the CSV in my email.

If other settings are left blank, supervisors and analysts will be granted access to calls from all agents entered in setting 1, in addition to calls from any agents that are part of groups entered for setting 2. Settings 1 and 2 work in together with OR logic. This means that access is granted when a supervisor or analyst has access to either a group or a user from that call flow.

Got this from Accounts Approval today. What happened?

I'm not sure if he is not in Slovakia but, there was another registration <zendas@sothaba.com>, and they have the same IP address so it prompted me to make tests. I made some tests using VPN, but the registration country detected is always Slovakia. Also, from Maxmind Data, ""Is VPN"" is No.Without using VPN: https://my.cloudtalk.io/phadmin/companies/showPreregistration/387277Using VPN (USA): https://my.cloudtalk.io/phadmin/companies/showPreregistration/387281Using VPN (NL): https://my.cloudtalk.io/phadmin/companies/showPreregistration/387283 My main concerns about this:We need to provide an IP address when we receive Law Enforcement Agency requests, so we need to have this data.Since registration from Slovakia is currently not allowed in auto-approval (https://cloudtalkhelp.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/323363), we will have fewer free trials as a result.
