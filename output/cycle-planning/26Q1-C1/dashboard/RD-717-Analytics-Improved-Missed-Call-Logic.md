# Analytics | Improved Missed Call Logic

**JPD ID:** [RD-717](https://cloudtalk.atlassian.net//browse/RD-717)

---

## Summary

WHAT
Fix inflated and confusing missed call metrics. Ensure missed calls are counted accurately based on outcome, not just ringing behavior.Pain Point: One incoming call that rings multiple agents or numbers is being counted as multiple missed calls, even if someone eventually answered. ðŸ’¬ Quote (Jackie Warrick): "It's showing as Missed, missed, missed. That's three missed calls. Agent four picked it up. It actually wasn't a missed, like a truly missed call where no one was available."â€¨
